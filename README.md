# star-wars-api-calculate

This project was developed to support the web application [the-star-wars-api](https://github.com/marialuisacp/the-star-wars-apie).
Do you like Star Wars? In this project ous calculated the necessary pitstops number for a starship run a determinate number of MGLT. (MGLT is a unit of measurement in the space).

That calcule was been done considering the attributes of starship: MGLT/hours and consumable (fuel capacity).

## Technologies

I developed in Node.js a API that receive all starships, calculate the stops and return. This API is avaliable on Heroku in the link: [http://starwars-starships.herokuapp.com/stops/:number_mglt](http://starwars-starships.herokuapp.com/stops/:number_mglt).
